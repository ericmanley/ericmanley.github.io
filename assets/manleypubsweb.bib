	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of image annotation for segmentation tasks. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with predefined categories, such as sky, cars, roads, and humans. Deep learning models require numerous annotated images for effective training, but manual annotation is slow and time-consuming. To mitigate this challenge, we leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) – a vision foundation model. We introduce SegBuilder, a framework that incorporates SAM to automatically generate segments, which are then tagged by human annotators using a quick selection list. To demonstrate SegBuilder’s effectiveness, we introduced a novel dataset for image segmentation in underwater environments featuring animals such as sea lions, beavers, and jellyfish. Experiments on this dataset showed that SegBuilder significantly speeds up the annotation process compared to the publicly available tool, Label Studio. SegBuilder also includes a free-form drawing tool, allowing users to create correct segments missed by SAM. This feature is particularly useful for scenes with shadows, camouflaged objects, and part-based segmentation tasks where SAM falls short. Experimentally, we demonstrated SegBuilder’s efficacy in these scenarios, showcasing its potential for generating pixel-wise annotations crucial for training robust deep learning models for semantic segmentation.},

However, to support teachers’ judicious integration of ChatGPT-generated code in mathematics lessons, it is necessary to provide learning opportunities through which teachers can experience interpreting, revising, designing, and evaluating programs in mathematics learning contexts so they can build knowledge for teaching mathematics with programming.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the capabilities of ChatGPT as a tool for supporting students in generating
mathematical arguments that can be considered proofs. To examine this, we engaged students enrolled in a
mathematics pathways course in evaluating and revising their original arguments using ChatGPT feedback. Students
attempted to find and prove a method for the area of a triangle given its side lengths. Instead of directly asking
students to prove a formula, we asked them to explore a method to find the area of a triangle given the lengths of its
sides and justify why their methods work. Students completed these ChatGPT-embedded proving activities as class
homework. To investigate the capabilities of ChatGPT as a proof tutor, we used these student homework responses
as data for this study. We analyzed and compared original and revised arguments students constructed with and
without ChatGPT assistance. We also analyzed student-written responses about their perspectives on mathematical
proof and proving and their thoughts on using ChatGPT as a proof assistant. Our analysis shows that our participants’
approaches to constructing, evaluating, and revising their arguments aligned with their perspectives on proof and
proving. They saw ChatGPT’s evaluations of their arguments as similar to how they usually evaluate arguments of
themselves and others. Mostly, they agreed with ChatGPT’s suggestions to make their original arguments more
proof-like. They, therefore, revised their original arguments following ChatGPT’s suggestions, focusing on improving
clarity, providing additional justifications, and showing the generality of their arguments. Further investigation is
needed to explore how ChatGPT can be effectively used as a tool in teaching and learning mathematical proof and
proof-writing.},

	abstract = {The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a seismic disruption to many disciplines and industries, including higher education. For the first time, students everywhere have widely available access to a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of generating content - including solutions to programming assignments in CS1 and CS2 - that can pass as the work of a high-achieving student while making traditional plagiarism-detection obsolete. This has spurred various responses in higher education, including a shift to more in-class and unplugged assessments. At the same time, LLMs are transforming the way that many people work, including professional software developers, and students similarly might be able to use them to enhance their learning. In this paper, we report on our experiences with a permissive policy towards the use of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools for assisting students with their programming assignments in CS1 and CS2 courses in the Spring 2023 semester. Students were allowed to use these tools however they wished as long as they submitted a form which included a transcript of their chat and a reflection on what they learned, if anything, through the interaction. We found that students largely approached the AI in positive ways and that they seemed to genuinely learn from the experience. We also document some things that did not go well and that remain challenges to using AI in programming courses, along with our recommendations on how these might be dealt with in the future.}

	abstract = {With the rising emphasis on computer science (CS) education, many states, school districts, and schools have grappled with how to address computing in the K-12 curriculum. While some approaches dedicate classroom time to specific CS topics, others are attempting to infuse computing curriculum into other subjects like math and science. Preparing educators without prior CS experience to teach this integrated content is challenging. In this paper, we share programming-integrated mathematics learning (PML) modules that we developed to support teachers in learning to use programming in mathematics classrooms through argumentation. To test the effectiveness of the modules, we implemented them in a mathematics content course for elementary education majors and a mathematics pathway course for non-STEM majors. We assessed both courses as study contexts for evaluating potential PML modules to enhance teachers' knowledge and students' learning outcomes in mathematics and computer programming. This paper focuses on student-written reflections as data to investigate how education and non-STEM majors describe their learning through the PML modules. According to our analysis, the study participants found the PML modules to be useful in enhancing their understanding of mathematical concepts. They also described the value of learning programming in mathematics classrooms through argumentation, learning different perspectives, and helping each other understand. However, most of our student participants displayed a relatively low level of confidence in their programming abilities, specifically regarding the creation of text-based programs. Future study is needed to explore how to increase the programming self-efficacy while students learn mathematics through programming.}
